This is the master repository for the Sporting Solutions Unified Data API Client for the .Net Framework.

Getting Started

 ICredentials credentials = new Credentials { UserName = "jim@bookies", Password = "password" };
 var theSession = SessionFactory.CreateSession(new Uri("http://api.sportingsolutions.com"), credentials);
 
 var theService = theSession.GetService("UnifiedDataAPI");
 var theFeature = theService.GetFeature("Tennis");
 var theResources = theFeature.GetResources();
 
 Resources are fixtures/events
 
 var theEvent = theResources.First();
 
 var theSnapshot = theEvent.GetSnapshot();
 System.Console.WriteLine(theSnapshot);
 
 theEvent.StreamConnected += (sender, args) => System.Console.WriteLine("Stream Connected");
 theEvent.StreamEvent += (sender, args) => System.Console.WriteLine(args.Update);
 theEvent.StreamDisconnected += (sender, args) => System.Console.WriteLine("Stream Disconnected");
 
 theEvent.StartStreaming();
 
 It really is as easy as that!
